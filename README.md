## About Me

I'm a Senior Research Specialist with a passion for making data accessible, actionable, and impactful. My journey started in exercise science and health data, leading to a PhD in neuro-cognitive Kinesiology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I thrive at the intersection of research, technology, and human well-being.

Currently, I manage data for the [Gateway to Global Aging Project](https://exposome.g2aging.org/) as part of the Environmental Exposome team at the University of Michigan.
